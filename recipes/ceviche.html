        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p> This is like a seafood salsa made out of all sour juices which help to cure the shrimp.<br>
            It's delicious and tart but full of flavours.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>5 large lemons, juiced</li>
            <li>1 pound jumbo shrimp, peeled and deveined</li>
            <li>1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro, or to taste</li>
            <li>tomato and clam juice cocktail</li>
            <li>2 white onions, finely chopped</li>
            <li>1 cucumber, peeled and finely chopped</li>
            <li>1 large tomato, seeded and chopped</li>
            <li>3 fresh jalapeno peppers, seeded and minced</li>
            <li>1 bunch radishes, finely diced</li>
            <li>2 cloves fresh garlic, minced</li>
            <li>tortilla chips</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Place shrimp in a bowl (You may either coarsely chop the shrimp, or leave them whole, depending on your preference.)<br>
                Add lemon, covering shrimp completely. Cover, and refrigerate for 30 minutes, or until opaque and slightly firm.</li>
            <li>Add tomatoes, onions, cucumber, radishes, and garlic; toss to combine. Gradually add cilantro and jalapenos to desired taste<br> 
                (jalapeno will grow stronger while marinating). Stir in tomato and clam juices to desired consistency. Cover, and refrigerate for 1 hour.<br>
                Serve chilled with tortilla chips.</li>
        </ol>
